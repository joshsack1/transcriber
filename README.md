# How To Use
## Dependencies
You need to have [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) installed. It is the tool that will allow you to download the video as an mp3.
You should also follow the instructions to [set up](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python) python for openAI.
## How to run the script
Use the command 
```zsh
python3.9 transcript.py
```
to run the script. It will then prompt you for a url and file name, which you should enter without any extension. Then the script will create a .mp3 and .txt file with the video information.
